# Dog-Rescue-Classifier-Leveraging-MongoDB-Python-and-Plotly
Full-Stack Dog Rescue Classifier: Utilizes Python, MongoDB, &amp; Plotly for efficient search-and-rescue dog identification. Showcases top-tier full-stack skills, database expertise, and innovative tech solutions.

# Search-and-Rescue Dog Identification Project

## About the Project
This project enables users to pinpoint dogs ideal for search-and-rescue training, aligning with Grazioso Salvare's specific breed criteria for critical situations. By utilizing existing animal shelter data, the project categorizes available dogs, implementing a comprehensive full-stack approach merging client, server, and middleware components.

## Motivation
Designing this project was a rigorous test of my database skills and data manipulation abilities, honed through extensive work with Python. MongoDB served as the cornerstone for its scalability and flexibility as a NoSQL, document-oriented database. The seamless integration of MongoDB with Python facilitated rapid application development, allowing for agile solutions.

## Getting Started
To launch a local copy, follow these steps:
1. Import 'aac_shelter_outcome.csv' into MongoDB.
2. Open MongoDB via the 'mongosh' command.
3. Authenticate users for Admin and 'aacuser' database access.
4. Develop CRUD operations in Spyder IDE using Python.
5. Execute the Python program through Jupyter Notebook.
6. Access the dashboard application address.

## Installation/Tools
- Spyder 
- Python ([Python](https://www.python.org))
- Jupyter Notebook ([Jupyter](https://jupyter.org))
- MongoDB ([MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com))
- Plotly ([Plotly](https://plotly.com))

## Challenges
One key challenge was encountered while working on the pie graph. Despite coding for visual representation, the graph retained all data points. This issue was resolved by identifying a lack of graph updating post-radio button selection for different data search values.
